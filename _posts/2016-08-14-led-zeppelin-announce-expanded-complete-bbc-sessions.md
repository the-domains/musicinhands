  A year after Led Zeppelin issued their final catalogue reissues, the group has
  uncovered more rarities: eight unreleased recordings they made for the BBC,
  including a "lost" three-song session from 1969. These new discoveries will
  round out an expanded and remastered edition of the band's 1997 release, BBC
  Sessions, which covers recordings made between 1969 and 1971, for what it has
  renamed The Complete BBC Sessions.
