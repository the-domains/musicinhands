  Ozzy Osbourne cannot believe that Led Zeppelin had to defend themselves in
  court last month, when a man representing the group Spirit alleged they'd
  ripped off that band's instrumental "Taurus" to write "Stairway to Heaven."
  "It's fucking crazy, actually," the Black Sabbath singer tells Rolling Stone
  as part of an interview that will publish in full in the future.
