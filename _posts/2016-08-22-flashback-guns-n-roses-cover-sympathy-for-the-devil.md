  Axl Rose and Slash weren't quite on speaking terms when the producers of
  Interview With the Vampire approached them about recording a cover of
  "Sympathy for the Devil" for the soundtrack. It was the fall of 1994 and the
  group had recently wrapped a 192-date world tour that stretched across
  two-and-a-half years and left a trail of riots and shattered relationships in
  its wake.
